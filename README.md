- Darker color from Dracula palette (#1e1f29) for editor, terminal, sidebar and tabs
- Strings are now Dracula green (#50fa7b)
- Comments are now italicised
- Few other colour tweaks

Just copy contents of json into **~/.vscode/extensions/dracula-theme.theme-dracula-#.##.#/theme/dracula.json** and relaunch VSCode.
